## Features

### Timeout test, forced failure with 1 milliseconds

#### Issues:

* http//atlasian.com/RUL-blah-story-num

Result: **PASS**
Time: 0

* Given: two variables x and y ->#what

```
def x = 1
def y = 1
```

* When: we use addition function with ->#what

```
def k = x + y
```

* Then:  we should get sum=2

```
k == 2
```

### maximum of 1 and 3 is 3

Result: **PASS**
Time: 0

* Expect: Math.max(1 3) should the function pics maximum number 3

```
Math.max(a, b) == c
```

* Where: 1 and 3 is passed to Math.max

 | a | b | c |   |
 |---|---|---|---|
 | 1 | 3 | 3 | 0 | (PASS)

### maximum of 7 and 4 is 7

Result: **PASS**
Time: 0

* Expect: Math.max(7 4) should the function pics maximum number 7

```
Math.max(a, b) == c
```

* Where: 7 and 4 is passed to Math.max

 | a | b | c |   |
 |---|---|---|---|
 | 7 | 4 | 7 | 0 | (PASS)

### maximum of 0 and 0 is 0

Result: **PASS**
Time: 0

* Expect: Math.max(0 0) should the function pics maximum number 0

```
Math.max(a, b) == c
```

* Where: 0 and 0 is passed to Math.max

 | a | b | c |   |
 |---|---|---|---|
 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | (PASS)

### maximum of two numbers when first number is bigger

Result: **PASS**
Time: 0

* Expect: 

```
Math.max(a, b) == c
```

* Where: 

 | testLabel | a | b | c |   |
 |-----------|---|---|---|---|
 | first number is bigger | 4 | 1 | 4 | 0 | (PASS)

### maximum of two numbers when second number is bigger

Result: **PASS**
Time: 0

* Expect: 

```
Math.max(a, b) == c
```

* Where: 

 | testLabel | a | b | c |   |
 |-----------|---|---|---|---|
 | second number is bigger | 0 | 5 | 5 | 0 | (PASS)

### maximum of two numbers when numbers are equal

Result: **PASS**
Time: 0

* Expect: 

```
Math.max(a, b) == c
```

* Where: 

 | testLabel | a | b | c |   |
 |-----------|---|---|---|---|
 | numbers are equal | 3 | 3 | 3 | 0 | (PASS)
